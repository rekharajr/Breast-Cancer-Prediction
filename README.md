# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

## Objective
To cluster the biopsy samples based on features of histopathological slides into two distinct groups, that will correlate with clinical diagnosis (i.e., benign or malignant tumor).

## Approach
Used several unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering, and K-Means Clustering for building the unsupervised machine learning model and comparing their clustering accuracies based on known diagnosis of the tumors.
